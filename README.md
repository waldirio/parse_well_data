# parse-well-data

Script created to parse some well data file.

Basically, you can call the script using python2
```
$ python2 parse_well_data.py 
Please, pass the well file as parameter
exiting now
```
As we can see above, the `well file` is required as a parameter.

Passing the file, the script will check if that file is valid, if not, you will be able to see a message as below
```
$ python2 parse_well_data.py tralala
File not found, please pass the valid path/file
exiting now
```

Now, let's inform the correct file
```
$ python2 parse_well_data.py pocos_exemplo 
<< correct formatted data here >>
...
```

Please, let me know if you need some assistance or some improvement on this code.
